I can try to generate a readme.md file for your repository, but I cannot guarantee that it will be accurate or complete. You may need to edit or revise it later. Here is what I came up with:

# Atomgrad: A simple and powerful autograd engine

Atomgrad is a Python package that allows you to perform automatic differentiation on scalar-valued functions and build neural networks on top of it. It is inspired by [micrograd](^4^) and [tinygrad](^2^), but aims to be more capable than micrograd and less complex than tinygrad.

## Features

- Supports basic operations such as addition, multiplication, power, logarithm, exponential, etc.
- Supports advanced operations such as matrix multiplication, convolution, softmax, etc.
- Supports activation functions such as ReLU, sigmoid, tanh, etc.
- Supports optimizers such as SGD, Adam, etc.
- Supports neural network modules such as linear, convolutional, batch normalization, etc.
- Supports GPU acceleration using CUDA or HIP
- Supports lazy evaluation and kernel fusion for performance optimization
- Supports graph visualization using graphviz

## Installation

You can install atomgrad using pip:

```bash
pip install atomgrad
```

## Usage

Here is a simple example of using atomgrad to compute the gradient of a function:

```python
from atomgrad.atom import Atom
from atomgrad.graph import draw_dot


# create two tensors with gradients enabled
x = Atom(2.0, requires_grad=True)
y = Atom(3.0, requires_grad=True)

# define a function
z = x * y + x ** 2

# compute the backward pass
z.backward()

# print the gradients
print(x.grad) # 7.0
print(y.grad) # 2.0

draw_dot(z)
```

Here is a simple example of using atomgrad to train a neural network:

```python
import numpy as np
from atomgrad.atom import Atom
from atomgrad.nn import AtomNet, Layer
from atomgrad.optim import SGD
from atomgrad.metrics import binary_cross_entropy, accuracy_val

# create a model
model = AtomNet(
  Layer(2, 16),
  Layer(16, 16),
  Layer(16, 1)
)
# create an optimizer
optim = SGD(model.parameters(), lr=0.01)

# load some data
X_train, y_train = ... # load MNIST data
X_train = Atom(X_train)
y_train = Atom(y_train)

model.fit(X_train, y_train, optim, binary_cross_entropy, accuracy_val, epochs=100)
```
